#summary Command line options for Hydra.

*Usage:*
{{{
$ hydra [OPTIONS] -in <mappings> -out <breakpoints> -mld <bp> -mno <bp>
}}}

*Required:*

|| -in	|| Input file of discordant mappings. [http://code.google.com/p/hydra-sv/wiki/FileFormats#Hydra_input_file_format Details.]||
|| -out	|| Stub for Hydra output files. [http://code.google.com/p/hydra-sv/wiki/FileFormats#Hydra_output_files Details.] ||
|| -mld	||Maximum allowable length difference b/w mappings. Typically set to 10 X m.a.d. of the DNA fragment libraries.||
|| -mno	|| Maximum allowable non-overlap b/w mappings. Typically set to median + (20 X m.a.d.) of the DNA fragment libraries.||

*Options:*

|| -ms || Minimum number of pairs required for variant to be called. Default: 2||
|| -lnk || Maximum intrachromosomal distance allowed before a variant is considered to be between unlinked DNA segments. Default: 1000000 (i.e., 1Mb)||
|| -is || Choose most likely variant (when a tie exists) based on least edit distance rather than size.||
|| -li || Combine +/+ and -/- mappings when screening for inversions. This increases inversion detection sensitivity in low coverage.||
|| -use || Which mappings should be used for each pair? "best" Use the mappings with the least edit distance for each pair (Default). "all" Use all mappings for each pair. N Use the best plus those within N edit distance of best.||
